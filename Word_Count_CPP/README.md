# Word_Count_File
Counts Strings in a file

Things to Note:
There is a slight bug when counting the strings. I've noticed when a particular file is large it will omit words. 
I'll be working on debugging this bug but here is the current code.

Purpose:
This code is a good representation of the simple implimentation of linked lists, analyzing contents in a file, and using the command line feature to take arguments.
Hope it's helpful. Please use for educational purposes only. I don't approve of copying for assignments... etc.

Contents:
The contents are the text files used for testing by this program. 
The program is all within a single cpp file. It's not a lot of code so being in one file seemed more appropriate.
